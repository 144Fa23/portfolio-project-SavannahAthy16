                    <p>For the first project of my graphic design studio, I created a logo for a local home bakery in town. Tiffany wanted her logo to convey the love she has for the food she bakes while also giving people and idea of what she sells.</p>
                    <p>I made this project to first of all, gain experierence as a designer and also to help someone in town. This was a promotion piece, so I did this work for her in exchange for a testimonial and getting my name out into the world.</p>
                    <p>After it was completed, this logo is now being displayed on Tiffany's social media and products. Alongside with this logo, she also recieved a menu of the items she sells that she put up on social media.</p>

                    <p>Working in the Marketing Department means I get a very wide range of projects from social media posts advertising an event to updating the Ambassador photos in Mabel Cook.</p>
                    <p>For this project, I created a new cover photo for the Northwest Missouri State Facebook. It had to be simple and general enough to represent the university as a whole.</p>
                    <p>This is such a cool project to look back on because it was something I did very early on my first semester at Marketing. Now it's displayed on the Facebook for all to see.</p>

                    <p>My work for the Northwest Missourian includes designing at least two pages every week, but it also includes designing infographics for stories. This graphic needed to highlight some major university mental health statistics.</p>
                    <p>The idea was to have shilouettes to highlight each statistic, and in a way, put a person with each one.</p>
                    <p>In print, this graphic accompianied a Board of Regents story that talked about the mental health of students on campus.</p>
